# Amusing-Music-2

This is a re-make of my final project for Game Technology I at Champlain College.
If you're just looking to play the game, it's available at http://www.jameskeats.com/amusing-music-2.html


In order to get this repo working, you'll need a couple different things.

1. At the very least, you'll need a Flash compiler. I use Flex with FlashDevelop, but theoretically anything works.
2. You'll need to download FlashPunk's .swc (http://useflashpunk.net/) and place it in the /lib/ folder.
3. You'll need to get the two fonts (Broadway and, yes, Comic Sans) and place them in the /assets/fonts/ folder. More instructions can be found there.
